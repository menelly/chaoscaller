## üß¨ Problem Statement

### The Critical Gap in Genetic Analysis
Current genetic analysis tools excel at predicting **Loss of Function (LOF)** and **missense impact** but completely miss **dominant negative effects** - one of the most devastating types of genetic variants.

**Why This Matters:**
- Dominant negative variants can be more harmful than complete LOF
- They actively interfere with normal cellular processes
- Existing tools like SIFT, PolyPhen, CADD miss these entirely
- Patients with dominant negative variants are often misdiagnosed

### What Makes Dominant Negative Special
Unlike simple LOF where you lose function, dominant negative variants:
1. **Still produce protein** (so LOF tools miss them)
2. **Actively interfere** with normal protein function
3. **Poison protein complexes** by incorporating defective subunits
4. **Compete for binding sites** with normal proteins
5. **Disrupt cellular pathways** through interference mechanisms

---

## üéØ Proposed Solution: AI-Powered Dominant Negative Prediction

### Core Innovation
Use AI pattern recognition combined with structural biology to predict when a variant will cause **interference** rather than just **loss**.

### Why AI Can Solve This
- **Pattern Recognition:** AI can identify subtle structural changes that lead to interference
- **Complex Modeling:** Can integrate multiple data sources simultaneously
- **Non-Linear Thinking:** Not constrained by traditional biochemical assumptions
- **Scalability:** Can analyze thousands of variants efficiently
