# 🧬 CHAOS CALLER - Genetics Demystification Platform

## 💜 Revolutionary Mission
**The translator, explainer, de-escalator, and emotional support goblin for genetic data**

Not a raw gene parser like iOBiO - this is for humans who got overwhelmed by SNPs and PubMed articles and just want to understand their genetics without panicking.

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement

### **The Current Situation**
- People get raw DNA data from 23andMe/Nebula
- They dive into complex genetic databases
- Get overwhelmed by technical jargon and scary-sounding mutations
- Panic over genes they don't understand
- Need medical-grade explanations in human language

### **Target Audience**
- **Used 23andMe or Nebula** and want to understand their results
- **Got overwhelmed by SNPs and PubMed** articles
- **Don't have medical backgrounds** but are scientifically curious
- **Want practical info** without unnecessary anxiety
- **Need context** for genetic variants and their real-world impact
