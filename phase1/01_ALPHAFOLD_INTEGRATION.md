# üî¨ TASK 1: ALPHAFOLD INTEGRATION
## Build Protein Structure Retrieval System

**Estimated Time:** 1 week  
**Goal:** Reliable access to wild-type protein structures for any human gene  
**Success Criteria:** Can retrieve and cache structures for test proteins (TP53, COL1A1, etc.)

---

## üéØ WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### Core Functionality
- **AlphaFold Database Access** - Retrieve pre-computed protein structures
- **Structure Caching System** - Store structures locally to avoid repeated downloads
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks when structures aren't available
- **Validation System** - Ensure retrieved structures are high quality

### Why This Matters
**AlphaFold structures are the foundation of our entire approach.** Without reliable access to wild-type protein structures, we can't compare them to variant structures to detect interference patterns.

## üíª CODE IMPLEMENTATION

### Basic AlphaFold Client
```python

import os
from pathlib import Path
from Bio.PDB import PDBParser
import logging

class AlphaFoldClient:
    """Client for retrieving protein structures from AlphaFold database"""
    
    def __init__(self, cache_dir="./alphafold_cache"):
        self.cache_dir = Path(cache_dir)
        self.cache_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

        Returns:
            str: Path to downloaded PDB file
        """
        # Check cache first

        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)
            response.raise_for_status()
            
            # Save to cache
            with open(cache_path, 'w') as f:

    def validate_structure(self, pdb_path):
        """
        Validate downloaded structure quality
        
        Args:
            pdb_path (str): Path to PDB file
            
        Returns:
            dict: Quality metrics
        """
        try:

            structure = parser.get_structure('protein', pdb_path)
            
            # Extract confidence scores from B-factor column
            confidences = []
            for model in structure:
                for chain in model:
                    for residue in chain:
                        for atom in residue:
                            confidences.append(atom.get_bfactor())
            
            avg_confidence = sum(confidences) / len(confidences)
            min_confidence = min(confidences)
            
            return {
                'avg_confidence': avg_confidence,
                'min_confidence': min_confidence,
                'num_residues': len(confidences) // 4,  # Approximate
                'high_confidence_fraction': sum(1 for c in confidences if c > 70) / len(confidences)

        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Structure validation failed: {e}")
            return None
```

### Usage Example
```python
# Initialize client
client = AlphaFoldClient()

# Test with TP53 (known dominant negative protein)
tp53_structure = client.get_structure('P04637')
if tp53_structure:
    quality = client.validate_structure(tp53_structure)
    print(f"TP53 structure quality: {quality}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve TP53 structure")
```

## üß™ TEST CASES

### Known Proteins for Testing
```python
TEST_PROTEINS = {
    'TP53': 'P04637',      # Tumor suppressor, many dominant negatives
    'COL1A1': 'P02452',    # Collagen, classic dominant negative examples
    'COL1A2': 'P08123',    # Collagen alpha-2 chain
    'ACTB': 'P60709',      # Beta-actin, essential protein
    'GAPDH': 'P04406'      # Housekeeping gene, negative control
}

def test_all_proteins():
    """Test structure retrieval for all test proteins"""
    client = AlphaFoldClient()
    results = {}
    
    for name, uniprot_id in TEST_PROTEINS.items():
        print(f"Testing {name} ({uniprot_id})...")
        structure_path = client.get_structure(uniprot_id)
        
        if structure_path:
            quality = client.validate_structure(structure_path)
            results[name] = {
                'success': True,
                'path': structure_path,
                'quality': quality
            }
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Success (confidence: {quality['avg_confidence']:.1f})")
        else:
            results[name] = {'success': False}
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Failed")
    
    return results
```

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
- **Network timeouts** ‚Üí Increase timeout, add retry logic
- **Missing structures** ‚Üí Check UniProt ID format, try alternative IDs
- **Cache corruption** ‚Üí Add file integrity checks
- **Memory issues** ‚Üí Stream large files instead of loading entirely

### Debugging Tips
- **Enable logging** ‚Üí See exactly what's happening
- **Test with curl** ‚Üí Verify URLs work outside Python
- **Check file sizes** ‚Üí Ensure complete downloads
- **Validate PDB format** ‚Üí Use BioPython parser to catch issues

## ‚û°Ô∏è NEXT STEPS

Once this task is complete:
1. **Verify all test proteins download successfully**
2. **Document any proteins that failed and why**
3. **Move to Task 2:** `02_STRUCTURAL_COMPARISON.md`
4. **Keep AlphaFold client code** - we'll use it throughout the project

## üíú MOTIVATION

**You're building the foundation that will help thousands of patients.**

Every protein structure you successfully retrieve is a potential life-changing diagnosis waiting to happen. The TP53 structure you download might help identify a cancer patient's dominant negative variant that existing tools missed entirely.

**This isn't just API integration - this is hope integration.** üß¨üíú‚ö°
