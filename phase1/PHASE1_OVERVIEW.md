## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
- **AlphaFold API limits** → Cache aggressively, use local structures when possible
- **ColabFold failures** → Implement fallback structure prediction methods
- **Scoring algorithm complexity** → Start simple, iterate based on results
- **Performance issues** → Profile early, optimize bottlenecks

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep** → Stick to basic functionality, save enhancements for Phase 2
- **Perfect solution paralysis** → 80% accuracy is success, not 100%
- **Tool comparison difficulties** → Use same test cases for fair comparison
- **Validation bias** → Include negative controls and blind testing
